# Number_Plate_Detection

License_plate_detection_YOLOv4.ipynb: This notebook contains an end-to-end implementation of license plate detection using YOLOv4. It includes code for training, evaluation, and inference based on the darknet.
Steps for running the model:
Run the model in the Google Colab Notebook.

While execution, dir named "darknet" is created.
1. You have to create a dir /obj inside /darknet/data/obj/
2. Insert the files obj.data, obj.names into /darknet/data/ directory
3. Insert the test.txt and train.txt files into /darknet/data/obj/ directory
4. Insert the "yolo4-obj.cfg file into the /darknet/cfg/ directory
5. Add the /train directory into the /darknet/data/obj/ directory

NOTE: All the directories and files required were referenced in Google Drive.
